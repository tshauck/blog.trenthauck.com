# City of Riverside Reporting

I worked with the City of Riverside to create a reporting dashboard to aggregate metrics from their various social media accounts.  In doing so, I created a responsive website utilizing django, docker, postgres, and bootstrap.  I continue to provide support for the site, and ad hoc analysis.
