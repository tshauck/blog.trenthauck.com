Summary: Summary of (relatively) static pages.

# Bibliography

[/bibliography][biblio]

Links and summaries of papers I've read that have be interesting or provided
some usefulness - at least enough to keep quick access to.

# Portfolio

[/portfolio][port]

A look at projects I've done that I can share.  A mix between consulting work,
writing, and contributions to FOSS.

# Goals

[/goals][goals]

Each week I set goals for the upcomming week and score the prior week.  This
page serves as the system of record for those goals.
